# Analysis Tools using Jupyter Notebooks
As of 2022, my mind currently revolves around the topics of development of data analysis software using Jupyter Notebooks as a primary toolset. I like the Notebook format's ease of use for both the developer and end-user, a clean interface with web-page like feel that breeds familiarity, and a better access to in-line debug/printing of variables that allow for error tracking. As an end-user, these Notebooks also allow for semi-finished reporting as raw data that is processed remains stored in Jupyter Notebook alongside code. This is a great feature for tracking data, code, and results together.  

The last few years have also seen development of more user-friendly add-ons in the Jupyter ecosystem such as [Voila](https://blog.jupyter.org/and-voil%C3%A0-f6a2c08a4a93) and [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), which are designed to improve end-user experience in two unique ways. These developments are exciting.
