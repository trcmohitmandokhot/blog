# Traffic is complicated! But why?

**Reference** - Tom Vanderbilt's Traffic: "Why we drive the way we do?" [Book-Website](https://tomvanderbilt.com/the-book/)  

For an engineer working in the field of transportation, Tom's book provides opportunities to visit the all familiar problems of traffic from a variety of angles. The most interesting angle for me was to view everyday mundane traffic situations like merging or being stuck in a queue, through the lens of human psychology, queuing models, and communication in complex environments.

There is something unique about traffic that makes perfectly reasonable humans display unreasonable behavior. The behavior is explained to be that in response to the environment we find ourselves in.  
Uniquely traffic jams offer an environment that is: 
- Unnatural for human communication. No ability to communicate intent cleanly.
    - Stuck with limited communication tools horn, turn signals, brake lights, speed/yaw (pointing-direction) of the vehicle. Maybe an occasional hand-gesture or a nod/acknowledgement.   
- Dynamically changing, which necessitates rapid decision making at high speeds.  
- Where each driver figures-out their own "driving-model" of how driving and navigating through traffic works. 
    - To enable rapid decision making, these models rely on quick inference and stereotyping of someone else's driving behavior.  

Traffic brings drivers with unique models, needs, driving capabilities, vehicle limitations together in a live uncontrolled experiment in a constantly changing environment. It is in this environment people have to answer questions like:  
- Should I merge now?  
- Should I let this driver merge?  
- Whose right-of-way is it at this intersection?  
- Where is this bicyclist intending to go?  
- Is this pedestrian going to cross?

Most of these decisions and execution of subsequent actions require an assessment of traffic's characteristics such as presence of gaps, speeds of vehicles, and which car to ask for space to safely merge. Safe navigation of these situations also require prediction of other actor's behavior and intent, with limited communication mechanisms available to verify them.  
Each actor in traffic has to make these complex decisions while uniquely acknowledging their own human weaknesses. It is likely that for some actors waiting in a queue is less bothersome than others. However, the same lot of drivers in other extenuating circumstances may feel differently about a long merge queue. Similarly, each actor has a unique capacity for decision making based on observations obtained by occasional glances in a vehicle's rear-view mirror gathered for a short time horizon. To add to this there are added factors along our roadways that lead to distraction and fatigue, making traffic situations worse.  
Traffic brings together a variety of actors with unique models, needs, driving capabilities, vehicle limitations in a live uncontrolled experiment in a constantly changing environment.  No wonder understanding traffic behavior and fixing it has proven to be a maze.
