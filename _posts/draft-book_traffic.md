# Traffic is complicated! But why?

**Reference** - Tom Vanderbilt's Traffic: "Why we drive the way we do?" [Book-Website](https://tomvanderbilt.com/the-book/)  

For an engineer working in the field of transportation, Tom's book provides opportunities to visit the all familiar problems of traffic from a variety of angles. 

What is a traffic problem? 
- Traffic Engineer: Congestion? Under utilization? Low throughput? 
- Everyday User: Difficult merge scenarios? Queuing? Backups? 

While traffic rules exist, they are mostly designed bound behavior of drivers at edges of the cliff. They may also appear to be prescriptive to users that may fall outside the norm for which they were designed.  

# Humans are generally reasonable. What makes them unreasonable when stuck in traffic?  

Humans are reasonable (generally). What makes humans stuck in cars unreasonable? 
- Unnatural environment for communication. No ability to communicate intent cleanly. "Looking at rear-end of a vehicle 90% of the time".
    - Stuck with horn, turn signals, speed/yaw (pointing-direction) of the vehicle. Maybe an occasional hand-gesture or nod/acknowledgement.  
- Also, when a human appears, natural tendency is to want to read their "face". Biological, over the years. This makes for slower reading "thinking fast and slow" and may be more detrimental to decision making in a traffic situation. 
- High speeds at which decisions have to be made.  
- Each driver makes-up figures-out their own "driving-model" of how driving and navigating through traffic works. These models rely on personal and cultural traits. They rely on quick inference and stereotyping of someone else's driving behavior and expectations.  
- Traffic brings drivers with unique models, needs, driving capabilities, vehicle limitations together in a live uncontrolled experiment in a constantly changing environment.  
- It is in this environment people have to answer questions like:  
    - Should I merge now? 
    - Should I let this driver merge? 
    - Whose right-of-way is it at this intersection? 
    - Where is this bicyclist intending to go? 
    - Is there a pedestrian going to cross.
- These decisions have to be made with human tendencies like: 
    - Time passes differently when waiting in a queue. In the case of traffic, when the queue ends is also unknown.  
    - Decisions have to be made about your actions in moving traffic based on observations about other actors gathered in a very short time.  
    - Loss aversion: Am I waiting in this queue while the other lane seems to be faster?  
    - Expectation of fairness in queues when navigating the queue and merging situations.
    - Tendency for distraction. "Flashy sign". 
    - Tendency for fatigue.
