# Traffic is complicated! But why?

**Reference** - Tom Vanderbilt's Traffic: "Why we drive the way we do?" [Book-Website](https://tomvanderbilt.com/the-book/)  

For an engineer working in the field of transportation, Tom's book provides opportunities to visit the all familiar problems of traffic from a variety of angles. The most interesting one for me was to view everyday mundane traffic situations like merging, being stuck in a queue through the lens of human psychology. 

There is something unique about traffic that makes perfectly reasonable humans display unreasonable behavior. The behavior is in response to the environment we find ourselves in a traffic jam.  
Uniquely traffic jams offer an environment that is: 
- Unnatural for human communication. No ability to communicate intent cleanly.
    - Stuck with horn, turn signals, brake lights, speed/yaw (pointing-direction) of the vehicle. Maybe an occasional hand-gesture or nod/acknowledgement.   
- Dynamically changing, which necessitates rapid decision making at high speeds.  
- Each driver makes-up figures-out their own "driving-model" of how driving and navigating through traffic works. 
    - To enable rapid decision making, these models rely on quick inference and stereotyping of someone else's driving behavior and expectations.  
- Traffic brings drivers with unique models, needs, driving capabilities, vehicle limitations together in a live uncontrolled experiment in a constantly changing environment.  

It is in this environment people have to answer questions like:  
- Should I merge now?  
(read traffic queue characteristics - gaps, speed, decide when to ask for space, read signs)
- Should I let this driver merge?  
(predict other driver's actions and decide safe merge strategy)
- Whose right-of-way is it at this intersection?  
(read intent, decide priority)
- Where is this bicyclist intending to go?  
(predict human actor's behavior without getting distracted)
- Is there a pedestrian going to cross.  
(predict human actor's behavior)

These decisions have to be made acknowledging human weaknesses and tendencies like: 
    - Time passes differently when waiting in a queue. In the case of traffic, when the queue ends is also unknown.  
    - Decisions have to be made about your actions in moving traffic based on observations about other actors gathered in a very short time.  
    - Loss aversion: Am I waiting in this queue while traffic in the other lane seems to be moving faster?  
    - Expectation of fairness in queues when navigating the queue and merging situations.
    - Tendency for distraction.
    - Tendency for fatigue.   

No wonder traffic is a maze.
