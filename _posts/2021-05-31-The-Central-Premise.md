**AVs and the Environment: Bi-directional Influence**

The performance of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) is influenced by the environment around them.  

SAE J3016[^1] defines six levels of driving automation. SAE Automation Levels 1 to 5 can be collectively grouped under the term Driving Automation Systems. Application of mental models such as the Sense, Plan, and Act Framework, can help us explain the behavior of a Driving Automation System.  

The environment around an AV may consist of a variety of objects, each with characteristics that are static or change. Modeling the environment in terms of objects and characteristics is a technique that aids in classification of the environment around an AV. For example, an object like the roadway can have a characteristic like geometry, which is static in nature. Speed (characteristic) of a particular vehicle (object) driving in an adjacent lane can change during the period of observation.  

The AV senses its operation environment. It gathers and processes information to produce a plan that can satisfy its goals. Next, the AV acts on the plan. The actions performed by AV change the driving environment around it.   

On seeing a vehicle change lanes in front of it, drivers may slow down to maintain safe following distance. Also, other elements of the environment may also respond to the presence and actions of an AV. For example, if an emergency autonomous vehicle needs right of way through the intersection, the traffic controller may change its mode to adapt to most critical needs.  

Hence, there exists a bi-directional nature of influence between the AVs and its operating environment.
