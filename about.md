## About NoteWorthy!
While, there is a lot of information available, finding relevant and useful information that is structured well is difficult. There exists a massive information overload.  
NoteWorthy is an attempt to structurize information better.  
We use techniques in X, Y, Z (graphing, reading, information absorption) to achieve efficient reading for the end-user.  
Currently this technique is being applied to two domains. 
- The Transportation Weekly (The application to transportation domain is unclear. "Weekly" throws me off). 
- Inspired Living: Living guided by a north-star, principles with deep roots in scriptures.
